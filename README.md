# pingmacos

# Specification
## Overview
- The app pings the current Wi-Fi connection to measure the speed.
- Users share Wi-Fi speed data with others, along with the time and date of the measurement.
- The app stores and displays data on a map, following the previous steps.

## Screen layout
- Map view displaying cafes and their Wi-Fi speeds.
- A popup or callout view showing Wi-Fi speed, time, and date when tapping on a cafe.
- A button or menu to manually trigger a Wi-Fi speed test.

## Behavior
- The app automatically measures Wi-Fi speed when connected to a new Wi-Fi network.
- Users can manually trigger a Wi-Fi speed test for the current connection.
- The app sends Wi-Fi speed data to the backend for storage and sharing.

# Output format
## Summary
- The test specification will use the equivalence partitioning method in mermaid format. 
- We'll create a Jest test code and a function in TypeScript for the React app.

## Test Code (Jest)
```javascript
import { getWifiSpeed } from './wifiSpeed';

describe('getWifiSpeed', () => {
  test('returns a positive number for valid Wi-Fi speed', async () => {
    const wifiSpeed = await getWifiSpeed();
    expect(wifiSpeed).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

# Wi-Fi Speed Measurement App Specification

## Specification

### Overview

The app pings the current Wi-Fi connection to measure the speed. Users share Wi-Fi speed data with others, along with the time and date of the measurement. The app stores and displays data on a map, following the previous steps.

### Screen layout

- Map view displaying cafes and their Wi-Fi speeds.
- A popup or callout view showing Wi-Fi speed, time, and date when tapping on a cafe.
- A button or menu to manually trigger a Wi-Fi speed test.

### Behavior

- The app automatically measures Wi-Fi speed when connected to a new Wi-Fi network.
- Users can manually trigger a Wi-Fi speed test for the current connection.
- The app sends Wi-Fi speed data to the backend for storage and sharing.

## Output format

### Summary

The test specification will use the equivalence partitioning method in mermaid format. We'll create a Jest test code and a function in TypeScript for the React app.

### Test Code (Jest)

```javascript
import { getWifiSpeed } from './wifiSpeed';

describe('getWifiSpeed', () => {
  test('returns a positive number for valid Wi-Fi speed', async () => {
    const wifiSpeed = await getWifiSpeed();
    expect(wifiSpeed).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```
## Example Implementation (TypeScript & React)
### wifiSpeed.ts (TypeScript):
```typescript

import { NetworkInfo } from 'react-native-network-info';
import speedTest from 'react-native-speed-test';

export async function getWifiSpeed(): Promise<number> {
  const ssid = await NetworkInfo.getSSID();
  if (ssid && ssid !== 'error' && ssid !== '<unknown ssid>') {
    const speed = await speedTest();
    return speed;
  } else {
    throw new Error('Not connected to a Wi-Fi network');
  }
}
```
This implementation checks if the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network using NetworkInfo.getSSID(). 
If connected, it measures the Wi-Fi speed using speedTest() from the react-native-speed-test package.

### App.tsx (React):
```react
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { getWifiSpeed } from './wifiSpeed';

function App() {
  const [wifiSpeed, setWifiSpeed] = useState<number | null>(null);

  const handleTestWifiSpeed = async () => {
    const speed = await getWifiSpeed();
    setWifiSpeed(speed);
    // Send Wi-Fi speed data to the backend and share with others
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Add your map view and other UI components here */}
      <button onClick={handleTestWifiSpeed}>Test Wi-Fi Speed</button>
      {wifiSpeed !== null && <p>Current Wi-Fi speed: {wifiSpeed.toFixed(2)} Mbps</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# measuring Wi-Fi speed on an iPhone using React Native.

Install the required dependencies:
Since React Native doesn't have a built-in method for measuring Wi-Fi speed, you'll need to use a third-party package like react-native-network-info to access network details and react-native-speed-test to perform a speed test.

## Install the packages:

```java
npm install react-native-network-info react-native-speed-test
Link the packages (if using React Native <= 0.59):

```java
react-native link react-native-network-info
react-native link react-native-speed-test
```

## Modify wifiSpeed.ts:

Import the required dependencies and create a new function called getWifiSpeed:

```typescript
import { NetworkInfo } from 'react-native-network-info';
import speedTest from 'react-native-speed-test';

export async function getWifiSpeed(): Promise<number> {
  const ssid = await NetworkInfo.getSSID();
  if (ssid && ssid !== 'error' && ssid !== '<unknown ssid>') {
    const speed = await speedTest();
    return speed;
  } else {
    throw new Error('Not connected to a Wi-Fi network');
  }
}
```

This implementation checks if the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network using NetworkInfo.getSSID(). If connected, it measures the Wi-Fi speed using speedTest() from the react-native-speed-test package.

## Modify the React Native component (App.tsx):

Update the import statement to use the new getWifiSpeed function:

```typescript
Copy code
import { getWifiSpeed } from './wifiSpeed';
```

The rest of the component remains the same, as it already handles triggering the Wi-Fi speed test and displaying the results.

With these changes, you should now have a proper implementation for measuring Wi-Fi speed on an iPhone using React Native. Keep in mind that the react-native-speed-test package performs a download speed test, which might not provide a complete picture of the network's capabilities. You may want to look for other packages or create your own implementation to measure upload speed and latency as well.
